DATA BASE ASSESSEMENT REPORT.

Name of the database: SoccerPlatform

Description: This database is a useful tool to store data of a soccer platform. It can be used by soccer teams to facilitate and upgrade the management of the team, also to get all informations about the players, games and managers.
We have 5 entities that are interconnected to each other to get all informations needed, all that with respecting the 3NF requirements.

- List of entities ans attributes:

team

- team_id (PK)
- team_name


game

- game_id (PK)
- gama_date
- game_time
- game_location


teamGame

- team_id (FK,PK)
- team_name (FK,PK)


player

- player_id (PK)
- player_name
- player_salary
- team_id (FK)


manager

- manager_id (PK)
- manager_name
- manager_salary
- team_id (FK)

As we can see from the informations above, we have a solid foundation for building our database.

Our ERD design respects the 3NF:
- It is 1NF: because each entity has a primary key, and each attribute will store exactly one value.
- It is 2NF: because the only entity with a composite key is teamGame, and this entity does not includes a 				non-key attribute at all.
- It is 3NF: because each attribute describes only the entity it is in and depends on the primary key of that entity.
